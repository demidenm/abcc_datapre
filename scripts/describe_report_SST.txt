  This report provides a summary of the e-prime behavioral data for the StopSignal task (SST) conducted as part of the ABCD study.
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong><u>Task Description:</u></strong>
  <br>
  The SST task, as described by Chaarani et al. (2021) and Casey et al. (2018), is a cognitive control task that measures inhibitory control.
  It aims to assess the ability to inhibit a prepotent motor response when presented with a stop signal. During each trial, participants
  are presented with "Go" cues (indicated by a right arrow) that prompt them to respond by pressing a button. However, within a certain time
  window after the Go cue, participants may also be presented with a "Stop Signal" (indicated by an upward arrow), requiring them to withhold
  their response. The delay between the Go cue and the Stop Signal is referred to as the Stop Signal Delay duration. The key behavioral measure
  of interest is the Stop Signal Reaction Time (SSRT).
  <br>
  <br>
  The SST task consists of a series of trials in which participants encounter Go and Stop signals. The frequency of Go trials between
  Stop trials varies, with an average of 4.9 trials. Participants complete two runs of the SST task, with each run consisting of
  180 trials, including 150 Go trials and 30 Stop trials. The goal is for participants to successfully inhibit their response on 50%
  of the Stop trials, resulting in a total of 300 Go trials, 30 successful stops, and 30 failed stops across the two runs.

  <br>
  <strong><u>SSRT:</u></strong>
  <br>
  The Stop Signal Reaction Time (SSRT) is the key dependent measure derived from the SST task. As described by Chaarani et al. (2021),
  the SSRT is calculated by subtracting the median Stop Signal Delay (SSD) of all successful stop trials from the nth percentile
  Go reaction time, where n represents the percentage of successful inhibitions.

  <br>
  <strong><u>Task Summaries:</u></strong>
  <br>
  The group- and individual-level summaries are calculated based on the behavioral data extracted from the *_events.tsv files.
  This data is obtained using a script that extracts relevant columns from the EventsRelatedInformation.[txt/csv] (EPI) files.
  <br>
  <em>Group Level:</em>
  The group-level summaries are derived from the curated individual JSON files. The main figure presents information for the available runs:
   Run 01 and Run 02. There are three figures:
  <ol>
    <li>Figure 1: Boxplot of accuracy for Go and Stop Signal conditions across all subjects in Run 01 and Run 02.</li>
    <li>Figure 2: Boxplot of mean response time (RT) for Go trials, Stop Signal Fail trials, and SSRT across all subjects in Run 01 and Run 02.</li>
    <li>Figure 3: Boxplot of the minimum and maximum Stop Signal Delay durations across subjects in Run 01 and Run 02.</li>
  </ol>
These values include all subjects who did not fail the EPI to *_events.tsv conversion. However, it is important to exclude subjects based
on the provided e-prime and fMRI QC flags in the data releases, as subjects who failed the DAIRC behavioral QC may still be included.
<br>
<em>Individual Level:</em>
The following plots are provided for each individual subject, representing Run 01 and Run 02. If a subject does not have data for a run,
an empty row of figures will be displayed. For each run, there are five figures:

  <ol>
    <li>Figure 1: Bar plot of trial type counts, including CorrectGo, CorrectStop, IncorrectStop, and IncorrectGo trials.</li>
    <li>Figure 2: Boxplots of response time (RT) for Go trials, Stop Signal Delay, and Stop Signal Fail trials.</li>
    <li>Figure 3: Line graph showing the trial-wise response times for Go trials, Stop Signal Delay, and Stop Signal Fail trials.</li>
    <li>Figure 4: Bar plot of the distribution of Stop Signal Delay durations.</li>
    <li>Figure 5: Bar plot of accuracy for Go and Stop Signal trials.</li>
  </ol>
Each individual summary includes an associated sidecar file containing information on total trial types, Go accuracy,
Go mean response time (MRT), Stop Signal accuracy, Stop Signal Delay MRT, Stop Signal Reaction Time, and
Stop Signal Delay duration (minimum, maximum, and mean).
