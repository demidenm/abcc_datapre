  This report is a summary of the e-prime behavioral data for the StopSignal task (SST) from the ABCD study.
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong><u>Task Description:</u></strong>
  <br>
  To paraphrase from <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-021-00867-9">Chaarani et al. (2021)</a> and
  <a href="https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.dcn.2018.03.001">Casey et al. (2018)</a>, the SST  task is a cognitive control task that assess 
  inhibitory control. It is hypothesize to engage a core group of brain regions that may explain differences in impulsivity and impulse control.
  During each trial of the SST task, participants are presented with a 'Go' cues, via the -> arrow, that prompts the participant to response via 
  button press. However, within the Go cue window <1000, participants may be presented with a Stop Signal, via an upward arrow. If the Stop Signal
  is presented participants need to inhibit their response. There is a delay between the Cue and Stop Signal, which is the Stop Signal Delay duration. The
  behavioral metric of interest is the Stop Signal Reaction Time (SSRT) that is derived from the data.
  <br>
  During the SST, participant see a series of of arrows, indicating Go and Stop signal. The frequency of Go trials between Stop Rights is 1 to 20 trials
  with an average of 4.9 trials. Participants complete two runs of the SST. There are 180 trials per run, whereby there are 150 Go Trials and 30 Stop Trials.
  The target is that participants successfully inhibit the Go response on 50% of the stop trials. In otherwords, across two runs the goal is 300 Go trials,
  30 successful stops and 30 failed stops. 
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong><u>SSRT: </u></strong>
  <br>
  The Stop Signal Reaction Time (SSRT) is the key dependent measures from the task. As described in <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-021-00867-9">Chaarani et al. (2021)</a>
  the calculation of SSRT is: "The SSRT was computed by subtracting the median SSD of all stop trials 
  from the nth percentile Go reaction time, where n represents the percentage of successful inhibitions" 
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong><u>Task Summaries: </u></strong>
  <br>
  The group- and individual-level summaries are calculated based on the *_events.tsv behavioral data. This data is curated using
  a script that uses the EventsRelatedInformation.[txt/csv] (EPI) files and pulls out the relevant columns. 
  <br>
  <em>Group Level: </em>
  The group level summaries are based on the extracted values from the curated individual JSON files. The main figure reports the 
  information for the available runs: run 01 and run 02. There are five figures:
  
  <ol>
    <li>Figure 1: Bloxplot of accuracy for each Go and Stop Signal conditions across all of the subjects for Run 01 and Run 02 </li>
    <li>Figure 2: Bloxplot of mean RT for Go, Stop Signal Fail and SSRT across all of the subjects for Run 01 and Run 02 </li>
    <li>Figure 3: Bloxplot of the mix/max Stop Signal Delay Duration across subkects for Run 01 and Run 02</li>
  </ol>
  
  These values include all subjects that did not fail EPI to *_events.tsv conversion. As a result, it is expected that subjects that failed the DAIRC
  behavioral QC are included here. Hence, it is still important to exclude subjects based on the e-prime and fMRI QC flags that are provided with the
  data releases.
  <br>
  <em>Individual Level: </em>
  Below are the plots for each individual subject. The plots are for run 01 and run 02. When a subject does not have data for a run, this
  will result in one empty row of figures (when curative plots, the script iterates over indices of N files that are 1+). For each run, there are five 
figures:
  
  <ol>
    <li>Figure 1: Bar plot of trial type counts (e.g., CorrectGo, CorrectStop, IncorrectStop, IncorrectGo). </li>
    <li>Figure 2: Box plots of the RT (ms) for Go, Stop Signal Delay and Stop Signal Fail. </li>
    <li>Figure 3: Line graph that plots the trial-wise response times (ms) for Go, Stop Signal Delay and Stop Signal Fail </li>
    <li>Figure 4: Bar plot of distribution plot of the  Stop Signal Delay Duration (ms)</li>
    <li>Figure 5: Bar plot of accuracy (%) for Go and Stop Signal trials.</li>

  </ol>

  Stop Signal Delay MRT, Stop Signal Reaction Time, Stop Signal Delay Durations Min, Max & Mean
