  This report provides a summary of the e-prime behavioral data for the Monetary Incentive Delay (MID) task in the ABCD study.
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong><u>Task Description:</u></strong>
  <br>
  The MID task is a response time task that engages cognitive processes related to cue anticipation, response, and reward consumption.
  It consists of three trial types: Win, Dont Lose, and No Money at Stake trials, represented by Pink Circles, Yellow Squares, and Turquoise
  Triangles, respectively. In Win and Dont Lose trials, participants are presented with conditions involving $5.00 or $0.20.
  In win trials, participants can either win or not win the presented amount, while in Dont Lose trials, they can either not lose or lose the
  presented amount. The task assesses memory, emotion regulation, and the participant's ability to respond within a specific time window
  (e.g., 150-500 ms). Participants receive feedback on their performance and reward after each response. The probe window is adjusted
  during the task based on previous trials to achieve a 60% accuracy rate. The task includes five cue regressors and ten feedback regressors.
  <br>
  After each response, participants receive feedback indicating whether their response was correct or incorrect and the corresponding
  reward or loss. For example, if a participant successfully responds within the probe window to a Pink "Win $5" circle, they receive
  feedback such as "Correct Response! You earned $5!" On the other hand, if a participant fails to respond within the probe window to
  a Yellow 'Dont Lose $5' cue, they receive feedback such as "You pressed too soon! You lost $5" or "You pressed too slow! You lost $5",
   depending on the timing of their response. Each participant completes two runs of the MID task, with 12 different versions.
   Each run consists of 50 trials, including 20 Win, 20 Lose, and 10 Neutral trial types.

  <strong><u>Task Summaries: </u></strong>
  <br>
  The group- and individual-level summaries are calculated based on the *_events.tsv behavioral data. This data is curated using
  a script that extracts relevant columns from the EventsRelatedInformation.[txt/csv] (EPI) files.
  <br>
  <em>Group Level: </em>
  The group-level summaries are based on the extracted values from the curated individual JSON files. The main figures include the following:

  <ol>
    <li>Figure 1: Boxplot of accuracy across all subjects for Run 01 and Run 02</li>
    <li>Figure 2: Boxplot of mean response time across all subjects for Run 01 and Run 02</li>
    <li>Figure 3: Boxplot of accuracy for each cue type (LgReward/LgPun ($5), SmallReward/SmallPun ($0.20), and Triangle [No Money At Stake]) across all subjects for Run 01 and Run 02</li>
  </ol>

  These values include all subjects except those who failed the EPI to *_events.tsv conversion. It is still
  important to exclude subjects based on the e-prime and fMRI QC flags provided with the data releases.
  <br>
  <em>Individual Level: </em>
  The following plots are provided for each individual subject, corresponding to Run 01 and Run 02.
  If a subject is missing data for a run, an empty row of figures is displayed.

  <ol>
    <li>Figure 1: Bar plot of accuracy for each cue type, with a black line indicating the target 60% accuracy and a dashed red line indicating the subject's accuracy across all cues</li>
    <li>Figure 2: Line graph showing trial-wise accuracy (%) for the run</li>
    <li>Figure 3: Bar plot of the mean response time (ms) for hit and miss trials (Note: sites using an old version of the MID task may not have 'Miss')</li>
    <li>Figure 4: Line graph showing trial-wise response times (ms) for the run</li>
    <li>Figure 5: Bar plot of counts for each feedback cue type (hit or miss) </li>
    <li>Figure 6: Bar plot showing the occurrence of trial-to-trial sequences from gain to gain trial, gain to loss, neutral to gain, etc.</li>
  </ol>

  Each individual summary is accompanied by a sidecar containing information such as total trials, trial order,
  trialwise sequence, trials per cue condition, trials per feedback condition, accuracy (%) by cue condition,
  overall accuracy, mean response time, and mean response time for hit/miss trials.
