  This report is a summary of the e-prime behavioral data for the Monetary Incentive Delay (MID) task the ABCD study.

  <br>
  <strong><u>Task Description:</u></strong>
  <br>
  To paraphrase from <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-021-00867-9">Chaarani et al. (2021)</a> and
  <a href="https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.dcn.2018.03.001">Casey et al. (2018)</a>, the MID task response time task that engages report
  processes such as the anticipation of a cue type response or the consumption of the reward type. The task consists of three trial types:
  Win, Dont Lose and No Money at Stake trials. These are indicated by Pink Circles, Yellow Squares and Turqouise Triangles, respectives. 
  For Win and Dont Lose trials, participants are either presented with $5.00 or $0.20 conditions. In the win trials, participants can either win (hit)
  or not win (miss) the presented USD $ amount. In the Dont Lose trials, participants can either not lose (hit) or lose (miss) the presented USD $ amount.
  engages memory and emotion regulation processes. The success/failure (i.e., hit/miss) depends on whether the participant responded within 
  the allotted time during the response probe (e.g., 150-500 ms). After each response, during the feedback phase participants are informed of their reward/performance.
  The probe window at the start of the task depends on the pre-scan practice MRT and during the task, the response probe is adjusted after every third incentivized trial. 
  The adjustment is to achieve a 60% accuracy rate across the task and the adjustment is based on the previous 6 trials. There are five cue regressors
  and 10 feedback regressors for the task.
  <br>
  After each reponse, participants are notified whether they were or were not successful in obtain the indicated report during that trial.
  For example, if the participant is presented with a Pink "Win $5" circle at the start of the trial and they successfully respond within the
  probe window, they will receive the feedback "Correct Response! You earn $5!". Another example, if a participant is presented with Yellow 'Dont Lose $5'
  and they fail to respond successfully within the probe window, they will be presented with the feedback that is either "You pressed too soon! You Lose $5"
  or "You pressed too slow! You lose $5". The soon/slow difference depends whether the participants response occured after/below the probe window.
  The participants complete two runs of the MID task which has 12 different versions. During each run, there are 50 trials with 20 Win, 20 Lose and 10 Neutral
  trial types.

  <strong><u>Task Summaries: </u></strong>
  <br>
  The group- and individual-level summaries are calculated based on the *_events.tsv behavioral data. This data is curated using
  a script that uses the EventsRelatedInformation.[txt/csv] (EPI) files and pulls out the relevant columns. 
  <br>
  <em>Group Level: </em>
  The group level summaries are based on the extracted values from the curated individual JSON files. The main figure reports the 
  information for the available runs: run 01 and run 02. There are five figures:
  
  <ol>
    <li>Figure 1: Bloxplot of accuracy across all of the subjects for Run 01 and Run 02 </li>
    <li>Figure 2: Bloxplot of mean RT across all of the subjects for Run 01 and Run 02 </li>
    <li>Figure 3: Bloxplot of accuracy for each cue type (i.e. LgReward / LgPun ($5), SmallReward/SmallPun ($0.20) and Triangle (No Money At Stake) across all of the subjects for Run 01 and Run 02 </li>

  </ol>
  
  These values include all subjects that did not fail EPI to *_events.tsv conversion. As a result, it is expected that subjects that failed the DAIRC
  behavioral QC are included here. Hence, it is still important to exclude subjects based on the e-prime and fMRI QC flags that are provided with the
  data releases.
  <br>
  <em>Individual Level: </em>
  Below are the plots for each individual subject. The plots are for run 01 and run 02. When a subject does not have data for a run, this
  will result in one empty row of figures (when curative plots, the script iterates over indices of N files that are 1+). For each run, there are five 
figures:
  
  <ol>
    <li>Figure 1: Bar plot for accuracy for each cue type with black line indicating target 60% accuracy and dash red indicating subjects run accuracy across all cues </li>
    <li>Figure 2: Line graph that plots the trial-wise accuracy (%) for the run </li>
    <li>Figure 3: Bart plot of the mean RT  (ms) for hit and miss trials (Note: sites using old version of MID task do not have 'Miss') </li>
    <li>Figure 4: Line graph that plots the trial-wise RTs (ms) for the run </li>
    <li>Figure 5: Bar plot of counts for each feedback cue type (e.g. for each cue type, there is a hit or miss feedback) </li>
    <li>Figure 6: Bar plot of the occurence of tial-to-trial sequence from gain to gain trial, gain to loss, neutral to gain, etc. </li>
  </ol>
  
  The is an associated sidecar with each subjects' individual summaries: Total Trials, Trial Order, Trialwise Sequence N, 
  Trials Per Cue Condition, Trials Per Feedback Condition, Accuracy  (%) by cue condition, overall accuracy, mean RT, and mean RT for hit/miss,
