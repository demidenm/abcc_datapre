  This report provides a summary of the e-prime behavioral data for the Emotional Nback (NBack) task conducted as part of the ABCD study.
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong><u>Task Description:</u></strong>
  <br>
  The Emotional N-back (EN-back) task, as described by Chaarani et al. (2021) and Casey et al. (2018), involves engaging memory and
  emotion regulation processes. The task includes high (2-back) and low (0-back) working memory loads and uses two categories of stimuli:
  faces and places. Within the faces category, there are positive, neutral, and negative faces. The most spatially reproducible contrast
  in this block design is the faces versus places contrast. The primary behavioral variable of interest is 'D-prime' (D').
  <br>
  Participants were presented with a series of images during the EN-back task, as depicted in Figure 7 of Casey et al. They were
  required to indicate whether each stimulus was a match or not. The task consisted of two runs, each comprising 80 trials (160 in total):
  40 trials of 0-back and 40 trials of 2-back. Each run included 20 positive faces, 20 neutral faces, 20 negative faces, and 20 places
  stimuli types, or 20 lures, 44 non-lures, and 16 targets.
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong><u>D-prime:</u></strong>
  <br>
  D-prime is calculated separately for the 0-back and 2-back conditions. The calculation involves determining the percentage accuracy
  (or 'hit') as the mean of the Stim.ACC variable from the E-prime files for each condition. The 'fail' (or 'miss') is calculated as 1
  minus the hit accuracy percentage. Both values are then z-transformed. D-prime is derived as the difference between the hit and miss
  values for the 0-back and 2-back conditions.
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong><u>Task Summaries:</u></strong>
  <br>
  The group- and individual-level summaries are based on the behavioral data extracted from the *_events.tsv files. This data is obtained
  using a script that extracts relevant columns from the EventsRelatedInformation.[txt/csv] (EPI) files.
  <br>
  <em>Group Level:</em>
  The group-level summaries are derived from the curated individual JSON files. The main figure presents information for the available runs:
  Run 01 and Run 02. There are five figures:
  <ol>
    <li>Figure 1: Boxplot of accuracy for each block type (0-back and 2-back) across all subjects in Run 01 and Run 02</li>
    <li>Figure 2: Boxplot of accuracy for each stimulus type (positive, negative, neutral face, and places) across all subjects in Run 01 and Run 02</li>
    <li>Figure 3: Boxplot of mean response time for each block type (0-back and 2-back) across all subjects in Run 01 and Run 02</li>
    <li>Figure 4: Boxplot of mean response time for each stimulus type (positive, negative, neutral face, and places) across all subjects in Run 01 and Run 02</li>
    <li>Figure 5: Boxplot of estimated D-prime values for each block type (0-back and 2-back)</li>
  </ol>
These values include all subjects who did not fail the EPI to *_events.tsv conversion. However, it is important to exclude subjects based on
the provided e-prime and fMRI QC flags in the data releases, as subjects who failed the DAIRC behavioral QC may still be included.
<br>
<em>Individual Level:</em>
The following plots are provided for each individual subject, representing Run 01 and Run 02. If a subject does not have data for a run, an
empty row of figures will be displayed. For each run, there are five figures:

  <ol>
    <li>Figure 1: Bar plot of accuracy (percentage) across all stimulus types (blocks, stimuli, and targets). The dashed red line represents the average accuracy across all types.</li>
    <li>Figure 2: Bar plot of mean response time (ms) across all stimulus types (blocks, stimuli, and targets). The dashed red line represents the average response time across all types.</li>
    <li>Figure 3: Line graph showing the trial-wise response times (ms) for the 0-back and 2-back conditions.</li>
    <li>Figure 4: Bar plot of the D' values for each condition (0-back and 2-back).</li>
  </ol>
Each individual summary includes an associated sidecar file containing accuracy and mean response time data for blocks, stimuli, and targets,
as well as overall accuracy, mean response time, and D-prime values for the 0-back and 2-back conditions.
