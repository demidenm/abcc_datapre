  This report is a summary of the e-prime behavioral data for the Emotional Nback (NBack) task from the ABCD study.
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong><u>Task Description:</u></strong>
  <br>
  To paraphrase from <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-021-00867-9">Chaarani et al. (2021)</a> and
  <a href="https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.dcn.2018.03.001">Casey et al. (2018)</a>, the Emotional N-back (or EN-back task)
  engages memory and emotion regulation processes. The task contains high (2back) and low (0back) working memory loads.
  It uses two stimuli categories: faces and places. Within the faces category, there are three types: positive, neutral, or
  negative faces. In this block design, the contrast that is considered to have the highest spatial reproducibility is in
  the faces versus places contrasts. The behavioral variable of interest is 'D-prime' (D').
  <br>
  During the EN-back task, participant saw a series of images (see Figure 7 in Casey et al) across two condition: 2-back or 0-back. 
  During the stimuli presentation, participants indcated whether a stimulus was or was not a match. Participants completed two runs of the EN-back task.
  Each run consistent of 80 trials (160 total), 40 0-back and 40 2-back occurences. During each runs of the 80 trials:
  there were 20 positive face, 20 neutral face, 20 negative face, 20 places stimi types or 20 lure, 44 nonlure, 16 target.
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong><u>D-prime: </u></strong>
  <br>
  D-prime is calculated for the 0back and 2back conditions. 
  The calculation: For each condition, the percentage accuracy (or 'hit') is calculated as the mean of the Stim.ACC variable from the E-prime
  files. The Fail (or 'miss') is calculated as 1 - hit accuracy %. The two values are z-transformed. D-prime is then derived as:
  0back hit - 0back miss and 2back hit - 2back miss.
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong><u>Task Summaries: </u></strong>
  <br>
  The group- and individual-level summaries are calculated based on the *_events.tsv behavioral data. This data is curated using
  a script that uses the EventsRelatedInformation.[txt/csv] (EPI) files and pulls out the relevant columns. 
  <br>
  <em>Group Level: </em>
  The group level summaries are based on the extracted values from the curated individual JSON files. The main figure reports the 
  information for the available runs: run 01 and run 02. There are five figures:
  
  <ol>
    <li>Figure 1: Bloxplot of accuracy for each block type (0-back and 2-back) across all of the subjects for Run 01 and Run 02 </li>
    <li>Figure 2: Bloxplot of accuracy for each Stimulus type (pos,neg,neut face, and places) across all of the subjects for Run 01 and Run 02 </li>
    <li>Figure 3: Bloxplot of mean RT for each block type (0-back and 2-back) across all of the subjects for Run 01 and Run 02 </li>
    <li>Figure 4: Bloxplot of mean RT for each Stimulus type (pos,neg,neut face, and places) across all of the subjects for Run 01 and Run 02 </li>
    <li>Figure 5: Bloxplot of estimated D-prime values for each block type, 0-back and 2-back.  </li>
  </ol>
  
  These values include all subjects that did not fail EPI to *_events.tsv conversion. As a result, it is expected that subjects that failed the DAIRC
  behavioral QC are included here. Hence, it is still important to exclude subjects based on the e-prime and fMRI QC flags that are provided with the
  data releases.
  <br>
  <em>Individual Level: </em>
  Below are the plots for each individual subject. The plots are for run 01 and run 02. When a subject does not have data for a run, this
  will result in one empty row of figures (when curative plots, the script iterates over indices of N files that are 1+). For each run, there are five 
figures:
  
  <ol>
    <li>Figure 1: Bar plot of accuracy (percent) across ALL stimulus types, e.g., blocks, stimulus and targets. The dashed red line is the average accuracy 
across all types. </li>
    <li>Figure 2: Bar plot of mean RT (ms) across ALL stimulus types, e.g., blocks, stimulus and targets. The dashed red line is the average ms across all 
types. </li>
    <li>Figure 3: Line graph that plots the trial-wise response times (ms) for 0-back and 2-back conditions </li>
    <li>Figure 4: Bar plot of the D' values for each of the two conditions, 0-back and 2-back </li>
  </ol>
  
  The is an associated sidecar with each subjects' individual summaries: By type accuracy and mean response time for Block, 
  Stimulus and Target. As we as overall accuracy & mean RT, and d-prime for 0-back and 2-back.
