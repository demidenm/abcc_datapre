    <h2>Purpose and Goal of the Report</h2>
    This report provides a summary of the e-prime behavioral data for the StopSignal task (SST) conducted as part of the ABCD study.
    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>The report serves the purpose of aggregating and summarizing subject-specific data extracted from JSON files,
    which are generated from e-prime summaries. This data aggregation is essential for drawing inferences about key
    behavioral metrics in fMRI tasks, such as accuracy, mean response times, and condition types.</p>
    <h3>Key Objectives</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Data Extraction:</strong> The report extracts subject-specific data from JSON files derived
        from e-prime summaries.</li>
        <li><strong>Data Aggregation:</strong> It aggregates this data across various variables into
        a <code>group_[task].csv</code> file.</li>
        <li><strong>Interactive Plots:</strong> Utilizing the data from the CSV file, the report generates
        interactive plots displaying the histograms and distributions of data points.</li>
        <li><strong>Hovering Information:</strong> When hovering over these figures,
        users can access additional information:
            <ul>
                <li>Boxplot: Displays statistics such as the maximum, 75th percentile, median, 25th percentile,
                and minimum values for the respective variable.</li>
                <li>Data Points: Provides subject-specific labels (file sources)
                and raw values.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Subject-Specific Figures:</strong> Clicking on a data point opens subject-specific
        figures in the same window. Right-clicking on a data point opens subject-specific figures in a new tab,
        ensuring that the group plots are not reset.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Utility of the Report</h3>
    <p>The report offers a powerful tool for researchers and analysts. It helps to identify anomalies or outliers
    in the data and gain insights into the distribution of data points, enabling informed decisions about exclusions
    consistent with the the aggregated and subject specific data.
    The generated <code>group_[task].csv</code> file can be used in various statistical
    programs like SPSS, R, Python, JASP, or other preferred tools for data analysis. Subject-specific information
    can be incorporated into analyses and manuscript reports. Additionally, after exclusions, subjects can be organized
    into a new folder containing a subset of JSON and PNG files, facilitating the regeneration of the report as needed.

  <h2>Task Description</h2>
  The SST task, as described by Chaarani et al. <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41593-021-00867-9">(2021)</a> and
  Casey et al. <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dcn.2018.03.001">(2018)</a>, is a cognitive control task that measures inhibitory control.
  It aims to assess the ability to inhibit a prepotent motor response when presented with a stop signal. During each trial, participants
  are presented with "Go" cues (indicated by a right arrow) that prompt them to respond by pressing a button. However, within a certain time
  window after the Go cue, participants may also be presented with a "Stop Signal" (indicated by an upward arrow), requiring them to withhold
  their response. The delay between the Go cue and the Stop Signal is referred to as the Stop Signal Delay duration. The key behavioral measure
  of interest is the Stop Signal Reaction Time (SSRT).
  <br>
  The SST task consists of a series of trials in which participants encounter Go and Stop signals. The frequency of Go trials between
  Stop trials varies, with an average of 4.9 trials. Participants complete two runs of the SST task, with each run consisting of
  180 trials, including 150 Go trials and 30 Stop trials. The goal is for participants to successfully inhibit their response on 50%
  of the Stop trials, resulting in a total of 300 Go trials, 30 successful stops, and 30 failed stops across the two runs.
  <br>
  <h3>SSRT</h3>
  The Stop Signal Reaction Time (SSRT) is the key dependent measure derived from the SST task. As described by Chaarani et al. (2021),
  the SSRT is calculated by subtracting the median Stop Signal Delay (SSD) of all successful stop trials from the nth percentile
  Go reaction time, where n represents the percentage of successful inhibitions.
  <br>
  <h2>Task Summaries</h2>
  <br>
  The group- and individual-level summaries are calculated based on the behavioral data extracted from the *_events.tsv files.
  This data is obtained using a script that extracts relevant columns from the EventsRelatedInformation.[txt/csv] (EPI) files.
  <br>
  <h3>Group Level</h3>
  The group-level summaries are derived from the curated individual JSON files. The Figures, left-to-right and top-to-bottom:
  <ol>
    <li>Figure 1: Boxplot and distribution of points for Go Accuracy (%) across subjects for Run 01 and Run 02.</li>
    <li>Figure 2: Boxplot and distribution of points for Stop Accuracy (%) across subjects for Run 01 and Run 02.</li>
    <li>Figure 3: Boxplot and distribution of points for Go Mean Response Time (MRT, in ms) across subjects for Run 01 and Run 02.</li>
    <li>Figure 4: Boxplot and distribution of points for Stop MRT (ms) across subjects for Run 01 and Run 02.</li>
    <li>Figure 5: Boxplot and distribution of points Stop Signal Response Time (SSRT, in ms) across subjects for Run 01 and Run 02.</li>
    <li>Figure 6: Boxplot and distribution of points for Minimum Stop Signal Duration (SSD, in ms) across subjects for Run 01 and Run 02.</li>
    <li>Figure 7: Boxplot and distribution of points for Maximum SDD (ms) across subjects for Run 01 and Run 02.</li>
  </ol>
  Conditions:
  <br>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Blocks</strong>: go = Go Trial, stop = Stop Trial, stopfail = Failed Stop</li>
    <li><strong>Cue Types</strong>: postface = Positive Face, neutface = Neutral Face,
        negface = Negative Face, place = Places</li>
  </ol>
These values include all subjects who did not fail the EPI to *_events.tsv conversion. However, it is important to exclude subjects based
on the provided e-prime and fMRI QC flags in the data releases, as subjects who failed the DAIRC behavioral QC may still be included.
<br>
<h3>Individual Level</h3>
Hovering and opening individual subjects figures in a new window/tap plots data for Run 01 and Run 02.
If a subject does not have data for a run, an empty row of figures will be displayed. For each run, there are five figures:
  <ol>
    <li>Figure 1: Bar plot of trial type counts, including CorrectGo, CorrectStop, IncorrectStop, and IncorrectGo trials.</li>
    <li>Figure 2: Boxplots of response time (RT) for Go trials, Stop Signal Delay, and Stop Signal Fail trials.</li>
    <li>Figure 3: Line graph showing the trial-wise response times for Go trials, Stop Signal Delay, and Stop Signal Fail trials.</li>
    <li>Figure 4: Bar plot of the distribution of Stop Signal Delay durations.</li>
    <li>Figure 5: Bar plot of accuracy for Go and Stop Signal trials.</li>
  </ol>
Each individual summary includes an associated sidecar file containing information on total trial types, Go accuracy,
Go mean response time (MRT), Stop Signal accuracy, Stop Signal Delay MRT, Stop Signal Reaction Time, and
Stop Signal Delay duration (minimum, maximum, and mean).
