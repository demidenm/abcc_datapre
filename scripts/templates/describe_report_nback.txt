  <h2>Purpose and Goal of the Report</h2>
  This report provides a summary of the e-prime behavioral data for the Emotional Nback (NBack) task conducted as part of the ABCD study.
    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>The report serves the purpose of aggregating and summarizing subject-specific data extracted from JSON files,
    which are generated from e-prime summaries. This data aggregation is essential for drawing inferences about key
    behavioral metrics in fMRI tasks, such as accuracy, mean response times, and condition types.</p>
    <h3>Key Objectives</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Data Extraction:</strong> The report extracts subject-specific data from JSON files derived
        from e-prime summaries.</li>
        <li><strong>Data Aggregation:</strong> It aggregates this data across various variables into
        a <code>group_[task].csv</code> file.</li>
        <li><strong>Interactive Plots:</strong> Utilizing the data from the CSV file, the report generates
        interactive plots displaying the histograms and distributions of data points.</li>
        <li><strong>Hovering Information:</strong> When hovering over these figures,
        users can access additional information:
            <ul>
                <li>Boxplot: Displays statistics such as the maximum, 75th percentile, median, 25th percentile,
                and minimum values for the respective variable.</li>
                <li>Data Points: Provides subject-specific labels (file sources)
                and raw values.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Subject-Specific Figures:</strong> Clicking on a data point opens subject-specific
        figures in the same window. Right-clicking on a data point opens subject-specific figures in a new tab,
        ensuring that the group plots are not reset.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Utility of the Report</h3>
    <p>The report offers a powerful tool for researchers and analysts. It helps to identify anomalies or outliers
    in the data and gain insights into the distribution of data points, enabling informed decisions about exclusions
    consistent with the the aggregated and subject specific data.
    The generated <code>group_[task].csv</code> file can be used in various statistical
    programs like SPSS, R, Python, JASP, or other preferred tools for data analysis. Subject-specific information
    can be incorporated into analyses and manuscript reports. Additionally, after exclusions, subjects can be organized
    into a new folder containing a subset of JSON and PNG files, facilitating the regeneration of the report as needed.

  <h2>Task Description:</h2>
  The Emotional N-back (EN-back) task, as described by Chaarani et al. <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41593-021-00867-9">(2021)</a> and
  Casey et al. <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dcn.2018.03.001">(2018)</a>, involves engaging memory and
  emotion regulation processes. The task includes high (2-back) and low (0-back) working memory loads and uses two categories of stimuli:
  faces and places. Within the faces category, there are positive, neutral, and negative faces. The most spatially reproducible contrast
  in this block design is the faces versus places contrast. The primary behavioral variable of interest is 'D-prime' (D').
  <br>
  Participants were presented with a series of images during the EN-back task, as depicted in Figure 7 of Casey et al. They were
  required to indicate whether each stimulus was a match or not. The task consisted of two runs, each comprising 80 trials (160 in total):
  40 trials of 0-back and 40 trials of 2-back. Each run included 20 positive faces, 20 neutral faces, 20 negative faces, and 20 places
  stimuli types, or 20 lures, 44 non-lures, and 16 targets.
  <br>
  <h3>D-prime:</h3>
  <br>
  D-prime is calculated separately for the 0-back and 2-back conditions. The calculation involves determining the percentage accuracy
  (or 'hit') as the mean of the Stim.ACC variable from the E-prime files for each condition. The 'fail' (or 'miss') is calculated as 1
  minus the hit accuracy percentage. Both values are then z-transformed. D-prime is derived as the difference between the hit and miss
  values for the 0-back and 2-back conditions.
  <br>
  <h2>Task Summaries:</h2>
  <br>
  The group- and individual-level summaries are based on the behavioral data extracted from the *_events.tsv files. This data is obtained
  using a script that extracts relevant columns from the EventsRelatedInformation.[txt/csv] (EPI) files.
  <br>
  <h3>Group Level:</h3>
  The group-level summaries are derived from the curated individual JSON files. The main figure presents information for Run 01 and Run 01.
  The figures, from left-to-right and top-to-bottom, include:
  <ol>
    <li>Figure 1: Boxplot and distribution of accuracy (%) for each overall and block type (0-back and 2-back) across subjects for Run 01 and Run 02</li>
    <li>Figure 2: Boxplot and distribution of accuracy (%) for each cue type (positive, negative, neutral face, and places) across subjects for Run 01 and Run 02</li>
    <li>Figure 3: Boxplot and distribution of mean response time (MRT, ms) for overall and each block type (0-back and 2-back) across subjects for Run 01 and Run 02</li>
    <li>Figure 4: Boxplot and distribution of MRT (ms) for each cue type (positive, negative, neutral face, and places) across subjects for Run 01 and Run 02</li>
    <li>Figure 5: Boxplot and distribution of calculated D-prime values for each block type (0-back and 2-back)</li>
  </ol>
  Conditions:
  <br>
  <ol>
    <li>Cues: lgrew = Large Reward ($5), lgpun = Large Punishment ($5), neut = Neutral/Triangle (no money at stake),
        smrew = Small Reward ($0.20), smpun = Small Punishment ($0.20)</li>
    <li>Feedback: h-lgrew = Earn $5, m-lgrew = Don't earn $5, h-lgpun = Don't lose $5, m-lgpun = Lose $5,
    h-neut = Hit - No money at stake, m-neut = Miss - No money at stake, h-smrew = Earn $0.20, m-smrew = Don't Earn $0.20,
    h-smpun = Don't lose $0.20, m-smpun = Lose $0.20</li>
  </ol>
  Conditions:
  <br>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Blocks</strong>: n0back = 0-Back, n2back = 2-Back</li>
    <li><strong>Cue Types</strong>: postface = Positive Face, neutface = Neutral Face,
        negface = Negative Face, place = Places</li>
  </ol>

These values include all subjects who did not fail the EPI to *_events.tsv conversion. However, it is important to exclude subjects based on
the provided e-prime and fMRI QC flags in the data releases, as subjects who failed the DAIRC behavioral QC may still be included.
<br>
<h3>Individual Level:</h3>
Hovering and opening individual subjects figures in a new window/tap plots data for Run 01 and Run 02.
If a subject does not have data for a run, an empty row of figures will be displayed. For each run, there are four figures:

  <ol>
    <li>Figure 1: Bar plot of accuracy (percentage) across all stimulus types (blocks, stimuli, and targets). The dashed red line represents the average accuracy across all types.</li>
    <li>Figure 2: Bar plot of mean response time (ms) across all stimulus types (blocks, stimuli, and targets). The dashed red line represents the average response time across all types.</li>
    <li>Figure 3: Line graph showing the trial-wise response times (ms) for the 0-back and 2-back conditions.</li>
    <li>Figure 4: Bar plot of the D' values for each condition (0-back and 2-back).</li>
  </ol>
Each individual summary includes an associated sidecar file containing accuracy and mean response time data for blocks, stimuli, and targets,
as well as overall accuracy, mean response time, and D-prime values for the 0-back and 2-back conditions.
