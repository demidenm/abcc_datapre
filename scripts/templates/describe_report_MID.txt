    <h2>Purpose and Goal of the Report</h2>
    This report provides a summary of the e-prime behavioral data for the Monetary Incentive Delay (MID) task conducted as part of the ABCD study.
    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>The report serves the purpose of aggregating and summarizing subject-specific data extracted from JSON files,
    which are generated from e-prime summaries. This data aggregation is essential for drawing inferences about key
    behavioral metrics in fMRI tasks, such as accuracy, mean response times, and condition types.</p>
    <h3>Key Objectives</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Data Extraction:</strong> The report extracts subject-specific data from JSON files derived
        from e-prime summaries.</li>
        <li><strong>Data Aggregation:</strong> It aggregates this data across various variables into
        a <code>group_[task].csv</code> file.</li>
        <li><strong>Interactive Plots:</strong> Utilizing the data from the CSV file, the report generates
        interactive plots displaying the histograms and distributions of data points.</li>
        <li><strong>Hovering Information:</strong> When hovering over these figures,
        users can access additional information:
            <ul>
                <li>Boxplot: Displays statistics such as the maximum, 75th percentile, median, 25th percentile,
                and minimum values for the respective variable.</li>
                <li>Data Points: Provides subject-specific labels (file sources)
                and raw values.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Subject-Specific Figures:</strong> Clicking on a data point opens subject-specific
        figures in the same window. Right-clicking on a data point opens subject-specific figures in a new tab,
        ensuring that the group plots are not reset.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Utility of the Report</h3>
    <p>The report offers a powerful tool for researchers and analysts. It helps to identify anomalies or outliers
    in the data and gain insights into the distribution of data points, enabling informed decisions about exclusions
    consistent with the the aggregated and subject specific data.
    The generated <code>group_[task].csv</code> file can be used in various statistical
    programs like SPSS, R, Python, JASP, or other preferred tools for data analysis. Subject-specific information
    can be incorporated into analyses and manuscript reports. Additionally, after exclusions, subjects can be organized
    into a new folder containing a subset of JSON and PNG files, facilitating the regeneration of the report as needed.

  <h2>Task Description:</h2>
  The MID task is a response time task that engages cognitive processes related to cue anticipation, response, and reward consumption.
  It consists of three trial types: Win, Dont Lose, and No Money at Stake trials, represented by Pink Circles, Yellow Squares, and Turquoise
  Triangles, respectively. In Win and Dont Lose trials, participants are presented with conditions involving $5.00 or $0.20.
  In win trials, participants can either win or not win the presented amount, while in Dont Lose trials, they can either not lose or lose the
  presented amount. The task assesses memory, emotion regulation, and the participant's ability to respond within a specific time window
  (e.g., 150-500 ms). Participants receive feedback on their performance and reward after each response. The probe window is adjusted
  during the task based on previous trials to achieve a 60% accuracy rate. The task includes five cue regressors and ten feedback regressors.
  <br>
  After each response, participants receive feedback indicating whether their response was correct or incorrect and the corresponding
  reward or loss. For example, if a participant successfully responds within the probe window to a Pink "Win $5" circle, they receive
  feedback such as "Correct Response! You earned $5!" On the other hand, if a participant fails to respond within the probe window to
  a Yellow 'Dont Lose $5' cue, they receive feedback such as "You pressed too soon! You lost $5" or "You pressed too slow! You lost $5",
   depending on the timing of their response. Each participant completes two runs of the MID task, with 12 different versions.
   Each run consists of 50 trials, including 20 Win, 20 Lose, and 10 Neutral trial types.
  <br>
  <h2>Task Summaries</h2>
  The group- and individual-level summaries are calculated based on the *_events.tsv behavioral data. This data is curated using
  a script that extracts relevant columns from the EventsRelatedInformation.[txt/csv] (EPI) files.
  <br>
  <h3>Group Level</h3>
  The group-level summaries are derived from the curated individual JSON files. The Figures, left-to-right and top-to-bottom:

  <ol>
    <li>Figure 1: Boxplot and distribution of point for accuracy (%) across subjects for Run 01 and Run 02</li>
    <li>Figure 2: Boxplot and distribution of point for accuracy (%) for cue types across subjects for Run 01 and Run 02</li>
    <li>Figure 3: Boxplot and distribution of point for mean response times (MRT; ms) across subjects for Run 01 and Run 02</li>
    <li>Figure 4: Boxplot and distribution of point for MRT hit/miss (ms) across subjects for Run 01 and Run 02</li>
    <li>Figure 5: Boxplot and distribution of point for number (n) of feedback conditions ([h]it = 1, [m]iss = 0) for Run 01</li>
    <li>Figure 6: Boxplot and distribution of point for number (n) of feedback conditions ([h]it = 1, [m]iss = 0) for Run 02</li>
  </ol>
  Conditions:
  <br>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Cues</strong>: lgrew = Large Reward ($5), lgpun = Large Punishment ($5), neut = Neutral/Triangle (no money at stake),
        smrew = Small Reward ($0.20), smpun = Small Punishment ($0.20)</li>
    <li><strong>Feedback</strong>: h-lgrew = Earn $5, m-lgrew = Don't earn $5, h-lgpun = Don't lose $5, m-lgpun = Lose $5,
    h-neut = Hit - No money at stake, m-neut = Miss - No money at stake, h-smrew = Earn $0.20, m-smrew = Don't Earn $0.20,
    h-smpun = Don't lose $0.20, m-smpun = Lose $0.20</li>
  </ol>

  These values include all subjects except those who failed the EPI to *_events.tsv conversion. It is still
  important to exclude subjects based on the e-prime and fMRI QC flags provided with the data releases.
  <br>
  <h3>Individual Level</h3>
  The following plots are provided for each individual subject, corresponding to Run 01 and Run 02.
  If a subject is missing data for a run, an empty row of figures is displayed.

  <ol>
    <li>Figure 1: Bar plot of accuracy for each cue type, with a black line indicating the target 60% accuracy and a dashed red line indicating the subject's accuracy across all cues</li>
    <li>Figure 2: Line graph showing trial-wise accuracy (%) for the run</li>
    <li>Figure 3: Bar plot of the mean response time (ms) for hit and miss trials (Note: sites using an old version of the MID task may not have 'Miss')</li>
    <li>Figure 4: Line graph showing trial-wise response times (ms) for the run</li>
    <li>Figure 5: Bar plot of counts for each feedback cue type (hit or miss) </li>
    <li>Figure 6: Bar plot showing the occurrence of trial-to-trial sequences from gain to gain trial, gain to loss, neutral to gain, etc.</li>
  </ol>

  Each individual summary is accompanied by a sidecar containing information such as total trials, trial order,
  trialwise sequence, trials per cue condition, trials per feedback condition, accuracy (%) by cue condition,
  overall accuracy, mean response time, and mean response time for hit/miss trials.
